📌 Leaf Disease Detection Model
📝 Project Description:
This project focuses on building a machine learning model that detects diseases in plant leaves using image classification techniques. By leveraging computer vision and deep learning algorithms, the model can accurately identify various types of leaf diseases based on visual symptoms.

Key highlights:

Built using Python and deep learning libraries like TensorFlow/Keras.

Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for image feature extraction and classification.

Trained on a labeled dataset of healthy and diseased leaf images.

Capable of classifying multiple diseases such as bacterial spot, rust, and healthy leaves.

Helps in early detection and management of plant diseases, supporting agricultural productivity.
